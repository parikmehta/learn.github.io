        <h1>Air Pollution, Simple, but Harmful</h1>
        <h3 class="by">By: Parik Mehta</h3>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of substance are released into the atmosphere.<br>
            These substances harm the environment, and harm the human bodies. Air pollution is basically a group of<br>
            substances that harm the environment in some way. These groups of substances can harm the ozone layer,<br>
            that protects humans from the direct heat of the sun, which can lead to cancer. In addition, air pollution<br>
            also is a huge part of global warming. It also causes humans to have headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Some<br>
            long-term effects include heart diseases, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Pollutants</h2>
        <p>
            Pollutants are small particles in the atmosphere that have adverse effects on humans, animals, plants, and<br>
            our environment. Pollutants are basically the small particles that lead up to air pollution. They can be in<br>
            any of the three states of matter, solid, liquid, or gas. Pollutants can be classified in two different groups,<br>
            Primary, and Secondary.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Where from?</h2>
        <p>
            Human activity has a huge role in the increase of air pollution. Here are some chemicals, that is released from<br>
            human activity, which increases air pollution:<br>
        </p>
        <h3>1. Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</h3>
        <p>
            Carbon Dioxide is the “leading pollutant”, or the pollutant that is in our atmosphere the most. In addition, it is<br>
            the most dangerous pollutant, as it harms the most. It is a greenhouse gas that is exhaled by humans, and it is<br>
            essential for plants. It is made of 1 carbon atom, and 2 oxygen atoms. We emitted billions of tons of CO2 annually by<br>
            burning fossil fuels.<br>
        </p>
            <h3>2. Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</h3>
            <p>
                Sulfur dioxide is another main pollutant that harms our environment. Sulfur dioxide is the chemical reaction of 1<br>
                sulfur atom, and 2 oxygen atoms. This pollutant is produced by volcanoes and many industrial processes. Coal and<br>
                petroleum’s combustion creates sulfur dioxide, as coal and petroleum contain sulfur. Sulfur dioxide is a dangerous<br>
                pollutant, harming our environment.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)</h3>
            <p>
                Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical reaction of one nitrogen atom, and 2 oxygen atoms. It is expelled from the high<br>
                temperature combustion, which happens during a thunderstorm or electric discharge. It is a toxic gas that has a<br>
                sharp, biting odor. It’s color is reddish-brown, and it is one of the most common and harmful pollutants.<br>

            </p>
        <h3>4. Carbon Monoxide (CO)</h3>
        <p>
            This chemical reaction is made from one carbon and one oxygen atom. It is odorless, colorless, and it is a toxic gas.<br>
            It is the combustion of natural gas, coal, and wood. Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of the CO produced.<br>
            It creates a smog like formation and is dangerous to life and the atmosphere.<br>
        </p>

            Here is an image of how much air pollution was released each state in the US, daily, in 2014 year.
